cakephp-timer
=============

Built using CakePHP, this repository will contain the contents of the app folder rather than the entire CakePHP application.

To set this up locally you should install CakePHP and replace the default app folder with the contents of this repository, you should then create a database and import the contents of the SQL file in this repository.

You will then need to adjust the contents of config/database.php to match your local database details.
